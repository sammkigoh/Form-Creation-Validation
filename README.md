Here is a breakdown of the task

Welcome to the “Deep Dive into JavaScript” project! In this project, you will develop a user registration form with validation and fetch user data from a public API. This project will enhance your understanding of form validation, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous JavaScript.

You will learn how to:

Validate form inputs using JavaScript.
Dynamically interact with HTML elements.
Fetch and display data from a public API.
Provide real-time feedback to users.
By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of advanced JavaScript concepts and be able to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, students should be able to:

Implement Form Validation:

Understand and implement basic form validation using JavaScript.
Ensure user inputs meet specified criteria before form submission.
Work with the DOM:

Use DOM manipulation to dynamically interact with HTML elements.
Understand and utilize event listeners for form submission and input validation.
Asynchronous JavaScript and APIs:

Use JavaScript to fetch data asynchronously from a public API.
Display fetched data dynamically on a webpage.
Handle potential errors during data fetching.
Enhance User Experience:

Provide real-time feedback to users for form validation.
Ensure data persists across browser sessions using local storage.
